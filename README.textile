h2. Usage

Get a google maps API key, and store in your app under GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
<pre>
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
</pre>

<pre>
directions = GoogleDirections.new(origin, destination)
</pre>
where _origin_ and _destination_ are strings of addresses or places that Google can find an address for.  Example: "816 Meridian St., 37207"

<pre>
drive_time_in_minutes = directions.drive_time_in_minutes
distance_in_miles = directions.distance_in_miles
</pre>
Call these two methods to get integers back for the entire drive time of the trip in minutes and distance in miles

<pre>
xml = directions.xml  
xml_call = directions.xml_call
</pre>
Call these if you want the XML Google returns containing all the driving steps or you want to see the URL

h2. Installation

h3. gem
# gem install google_directions
# add config.gem "google_directions" to your environment.rb file

Or do Bundler's Gemfile

h3. Rails 2.3.8 compatible

Not yet tested on Rails 3.  It probably is Rails 3 compatible, because it's just a single class with a few methods.  It's probably compatible with every ruby project ever.

h3. Google maps API key

You'll need a Google Map API key
