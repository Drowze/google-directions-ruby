h2. Usage

Get a google maps API key, and store in your app under GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
<pre>GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = 'your_api_key'</pre>

<pre>directions = GoogleDirections.new(origin, destination)</pre>
where _origin_ and _destination_ are strings of addresses or places that Google can find an address for.  Example: "816 Meridian St., 37207"

Get drive time or distance of whole trip
<pre>
drive_time_in_minutes = directions.drive_time_in_minutes
distance_in_miles = directions.distance_in_miles
</pre>

Get the XML Google returns with every turn, or the API call URL
<pre>
xml = directions.xml  
xml_call = directions.xml_call
</pre>

h3. Compatibility

Tested on Rails 2.3.8

Not yet tested on Rails 3.  It probably is Rails 3 compatible, because it's just a single class with a few methods.  It's probably compatible with every ruby project ever.

h3. Google maps API key

You'll need a Google Map API key

http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html

Include it as the constant GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY in an app configuration file (environment.rb, config/initializers/api_keys.rb)
